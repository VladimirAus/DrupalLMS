Fresh from debuting at Drupal South (Australia) in March 2015, Drupal 8 Learning Management System (LMS) - codenamed Project Lantern - is the collection of Drupal modules and distributions aimed at education sector. Drawing inspiration from Drupal Commerce approach and Drupal Community, Project Lantern sets the goal to bring Drupal closer to education.

There is no simple solution to cover all the challenges that education is currently facing. The number of software applications that are currently on the market are addressing only fraction of requested features. After extensive research and the number of specialized and customized projects for universities, we set the goal to create LMS that education sector is craving for.

This session will address:
- history of education software including current education software leaders (open source and others)
- education software approaches: collaborative (using LMS with Drupal) versus standalone (can Drupal be an LMS?)
- LMS for Drupal 8: today and tomorrow
